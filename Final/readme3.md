| Sentiment.csv      | Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset |   


- The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. 

- They reflect a new worldwide demand for more attention to happiness as a criteria for government policy.

- The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity 

– contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

- They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
